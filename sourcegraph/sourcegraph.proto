// retrieve the pre-resolved commit ID (e.g., "af4cd6") and still return data that
// constructs URLs using the unresolved revspec (e.g., "master").
// 
// Why is it important/useful to pass the resolved commit ID instead of just using
// a revspec everywhere? Consider this case. Your application wants to make a bunch
// of requests for resources relating to "master"; for example, it wants to
// retrieve a source file foo.go at master and all of the definitions and
// references contained in the file. This may consist of dozens of API calls. If
// each API call specified just "master", there would be 2 problems: (1) each API
// call would have to re-resolve "master" to its actual commit ID, which takes a
// lot of extra work; and (2) if the "master" ref changed during the API calls (if
// someone pushed in the middle of the API call, for example), then your
// application would receive data from 2 different commits. The solution is for
// your application to resolve the revspec once and pass both the original revspec
// and the resolved commit ID in all API calls it makes.
// 
// And why do we want to preserve the unresolved revspec? In this case, your app
// wants to let the user continue browsing "master". If the API data all referred
// to a specific commit ID, then the user would cease browsing master the next time
// she clicked a link on your app. Preserving the revspec gives the user a choice
// whether to use the absolute commit ID or the revspec (similar to how GitHub lets
// you canonicalize a URL with 'y' but does not default to using the canonical

// A Build represents a scheduled, completed, or failed repository analysis and

// is no single kind of worker; currently there are 3 things that could be
// considered workers because they build builds or perform tasks: the builders on
// Sourcegraph.com, the task workers that run import tasks, and anyone who runs
// `src push` locally.

// Both builds and tasks have a Queue bool field. If a process creates a build or
// task that has Queue=true, that means that it relinquishes responsibility for it;
// some other queue workers (on the server, for example) will dequeue and complete
// it. If Queue=false, then the process that created it is responsible for
// completing it. The only exception to this is that after a certain timeout (on
// the order of 45 minutes), started but unfinished builds are marked as failed.
// 
// A build and its tasks may be queued (or not queued) independently. A build may
// have Queue=true and its tasks may all have Queue=false; this occurs when a build
// is enqueued by a user and subsequently dequeued by a builder, which creates and
// performs the tasks as a single process. Or a build may have Queue=false and it

// direct DB access, can do).

// create a queued task in the same build to import the build data it produced.
